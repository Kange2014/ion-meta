# Paths:
#   Paths are resolved through the following rules:
#     1. If the path is absolute, the path is parsed as-is
#     2. If the path is not absolute, the path at 'workdir' is appended to it
#     3. If the path is not 'output_fp', the path is checked to ensure it exists
#
#   Paths should not include trailing "/"
